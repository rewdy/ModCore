ModCore
=======

A modular website core setup. Built on lesscss and a custom grid system.

---

I created this to be an easy site prototyping setup. While I often like to use existing frameworks for my development (foudation, bootstrap, etc) I frequently found that they offerend far more features than I needed for most sites.

As I started using lesscss (lesscss.org) I realized that lesscss provided a great system on top of which to built a "framework" or sorts that was more modular. If I didn't need a feature, I could easily comment out the import in my .less file and not load unnecessary code.

So, here it is. Use it if you like. Improve it if you like and I may merge it back in.

Peace, love, and happiness.
